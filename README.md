# Note Taker


## Description

We all need to remember things occasionally or just need more structure. Keeping yourself organized and on top of your to-do list is challenging, but this application makes that challenge a little easier. It creates a space where people can write down or access their thoughts and notes in an organized fashion.

## Usage

Using this application is easy. First, click the “Get Started” button. Then the webpage takes you to the main page. This is where you access and create notes. All the notes will be displayed in a column on the left side of the page. Click on a note, and it will display it. To create a note, click the plus sign on the top page and give your note a title and body. When you are done writing your note, click the save icon on the top of the page, and it will add it to your notes.

## Roadmap

I would like to add an urgency feature that would order the notes by date and urgency.
